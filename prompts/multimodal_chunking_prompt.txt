Your task is to analyze the visual structure and content of the PDF document pages shown in these images.

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- For each logical section of content, create a chunk with a structured hierarchical heading.
- Each chunk must follow this exact format:
  CHUNK [continues: (true|false|partial)]
  HEADING: [Main Heading] > [Section Heading] > [Chunk Title]
  CONTENT:
  [Complete text content of the chunk]
  END CHUNK

- For chunks containing figures, charts, or visualizations, structure the CONTENT section as:
  [Original figure caption or title]
  
  [Detailed description and interpretation of the visualization]
  
  [Any additional text content related to the figure]

HEADING STRUCTURE GUIDELINES:
- Main Heading: The document's primary title or the broadest topic
- Section Heading: Logical sections or sub-topics within the main topic
- Chunk Title: A concise description of the specific content in this chunk

CHUNKING GUIDELINES:
- Create semantically meaningful chunks that represent complete, coherent information units
- Keep related content together (e.g., a paragraph, a list, a table)
- Maintain a reasonable chunk size (typically 1-3 paragraphs or a distinct logical unit)
- For figures/charts/graphs: Include both the visual element and your detailed interpretation
- When a figure has a caption, include both the caption and your explanation of the figure
- The "continues" flag must be set as:
  * "false" - This chunk is a new, independent piece of content
  * "true" - This chunk is a direct continuation of the previous chunk
  * "partial" - This content is part of a larger section that continues in the next chunk

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Preserve the hierarchical structure of the document
2. Maintain all text formatting where possible (bullet points, numbering, etc.)
3. For tables: Keep the entire table together in one chunk when possible
4. For lists: Keep related list items together
5. For text that spans multiple columns: Read across columns correctly
6. Pay attention to page boundaries - content may continue across pages

FIGURE & VISUALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. For any figure, chart, graph, or visualization:
   a. Include a detailed description of what the visualization shows
   b. Explain key trends, patterns, or insights visible in the data
   c. Describe axes, legends, data points, and their relationships
   d. Connect the visualization to the surrounding context
2. Don't just transcribe labels - interpret and explain what the visualization means
3. For complex figures, include:
   a. The overall purpose/conclusion of the visualization
   b. Specific numerical insights when visible
   c. Comparisons between different elements
4. For diagrams or flowcharts:
   a. Explain the overall structure and purpose
   b. Describe key components and their relationships
   c. Clarify the sequence or process being illustrated

CONTEXT INFORMATION:
{context}

Analyze the document thoroughly and provide chunks that are semantically complete, logically structured, and follow the required format exactly.

EXAMPLE OF FIGURE CHUNKING:
Here's an example of how to chunk a figure or chart:

CHUNK [continues: false]
HEADING: Economic Report 2023 > Market Trends > Quarterly Revenue Growth Chart
CONTENT:
Figure 1: Quarterly Revenue Growth (2020-2023)

This bar chart displays quarterly revenue growth percentages from Q1 2020 through Q4 2023. The visualization reveals a clear upward trend starting in Q3 2021, with the highest growth of 15.8% occurring in Q2 2023. The initial quarters (Q1-Q2 2020) show negative growth of approximately -5% to -8%, likely reflecting the economic impact of the pandemic. The turning point appears in Q4 2020 when growth returns to positive territory (2.1%). The subsequent quarters show steady improvement, with some seasonal fluctuations visible in Q4 of each year. The most recent quarter (Q4 2023) shows a slight decline to 12.3% from the previous quarter, potentially indicating a normalization of growth rates after the post-pandemic recovery period.
END CHUNK
