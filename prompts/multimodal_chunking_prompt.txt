Your task is to analyze the visual structure and content of the PDF document pages shown in these images.

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- For each logical section of content, create a chunk with a structured hierarchical heading.
- Each chunk must follow this exact format:
  CHUNK [continues: (true|false|partial)]
  HEADING: [Main Heading] > [Section Heading] > [Chunk Title]
  CONTENT:
  [Complete text content of the chunk]
  END CHUNK

HEADING STRUCTURE GUIDELINES:
- Main Heading: The document's primary title or the broadest topic
- Section Heading: Logical sections or sub-topics within the main topic
- Chunk Title: A concise description of the specific content in this chunk

CHUNKING GUIDELINES:
- Create semantically meaningful chunks that represent complete, coherent information units
- Keep related content together (e.g., a paragraph, a list, a table)
- Maintain a reasonable chunk size (typically 1-3 paragraphs or a distinct logical unit)
- The "continues" flag must be set as:
  * "false" - This chunk is a new, independent piece of content
  * "true" - This chunk is a direct continuation of the previous chunk
  * "partial" - This content is part of a larger section that continues in the next chunk

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Preserve the hierarchical structure of the document
2. Maintain all text formatting where possible (bullet points, numbering, etc.)
3. For tables: Keep the entire table together in one chunk when possible
4. For lists: Keep related list items together
5. For text that spans multiple columns: Read across columns correctly
6. Pay attention to page boundaries - content may continue across pages

CONTEXT INFORMATION:
{context}

Analyze the document thoroughly and provide chunks that are semantically complete, logically structured, and follow the required format exactly.
