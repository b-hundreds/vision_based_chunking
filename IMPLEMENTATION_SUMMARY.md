# Vision-Based Chunking Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

We've implemented a vision-based chunking algorithm for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that processes PDF documents using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to create intelligent, context-rich chunks. This approach overcomes limitations of traditional text-only chunking by understanding both the visual layout and textual content of documents.

## Key Components

1. **Batch Processing**
   - `BatchProcessor`: Splits documents into batches of configurable page count
   - `PageImage`: Represents a document page as an image with metadata

2. **Context Management**
   - `ContextManager`: Preserves context between batches
   - `Context`: Stores summary, last chunk, heading hierarchy, and metadata

3. **LMM Processing**
   - `LMMClient`: Interfaces with multimodal models (Gemini, OpenAI)
   - Implements sophisticated prompting for intelligent chunking

4. **Chunk Processing**
   - `ChunkProcessor`: Extracts and validates chunks from LMM output
   - Handles merging of related chunks based on continuation flags

5. **Vector Database Integration**
   - `VectorDB`: Abstract base class for vector database integration
   - `ElasticsearchDB`: Concrete implementation for Elasticsearch

6. **Utilities**
   - `PDFExtractor`: Converts PDF pages to images for LMM processing

## Key Features

- **Multimodal Processing**: Uses LMMs to "see" the visual layout and "read" content
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multi-page segments to preserve context
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains heading hierarchies and continuity
- **Intelligent Chunking Rules**:
  - Preserves tables, lists, diagrams with their context
  - Creates continuation flags to indicate relationships between chunks
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Each chunk includes structural context

## Usage Example

```python
from src import get_vision_chunker
VisionChunker = get_vision_chunker()

# Initialize the chunker
chunker = VisionChunker(
    batch_size=4,
    lmm_model="gemini-2.5-pro",
    embedding_model="text-embedding-3-small",
)

# Process a document
chunks = chunker.process_document("path/to/document.pdf")

# Store chunks in vector database
chunker.ingest_chunks(chunks)
```

## Implementation Notes

- The implementation uses the LMM's visual understanding to respect document layout
- Chunks maintain their heading hierarchy for better context
- Continuation flags indicate relationships between chunks
- The approach handles complex elements like tables by creating row-based chunks with headers
- The full implementation includes error handling, validation, and extensive logging
